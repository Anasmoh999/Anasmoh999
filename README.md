Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow".

Data Engineer with three years of experience at SESAME, working within the Data Collection & Analysis Team. Specialized in designing and developing advanced data acquisition systems (DAQ) for scientific beamlines under Linux platforms. Bridging the gap between experimental science and high-performance data infrastructure—translating raw detector signals into structured, searchable, and citable scientific data.

Key areas of expertise include:
  •	Designing and optimizing real-time and batch data pipelines for efficient data handling and storage.
  •	Implementing data visualization solutions to support scientific analysis and experimental insight.
  •	Working with DAQ hardware and synchronizing FPGA-based systems, including PandABox, for precise control and data timing.
  •	Designing metadata workflows that integrate with user portals and comply with Experimental Data Management Policy.
  •	Automating DOI assignment through DataCite, ensuring SESAME Experimental Data (SED) is FAIR, persistent, and publishable.
